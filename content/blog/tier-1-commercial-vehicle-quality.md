## A Tier 1 Supplier's Journey from 15-Minute Inspections to 45 Seconds

In the world of commercial vehicle manufacturing, quality assurance is non-negotiable. For one Tier 1 supplier specializing in **fabrication and metal forming**, ensuring precision across thousands of parts per month was a serious operational challenge.

Before VISPECT, their most complex part—requiring **five different views and 150 individual part identification checks**—took around **15 minutes** to inspect manually. This created delays, fatigue, and inconsistencies across operators and shifts. Also, this was with an experienced operator, who could only inspect a limited number of parts per hour.

With VISPECT, the same inspection now takes **under 45 seconds**, and the process can be performed by any operator, regardless of experience. This transformation not only speeds up production but also ensures that every part meets the highest quality standards.
