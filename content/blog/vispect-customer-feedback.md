At Vispect, we know real feedback from users is invaluable. Here’s the genuine, unedited voice of a plant quality head who implemented the Vispect AI visual inspection system in their factory:

---

> **“Most important benefit Sir, No need for trained operator. New boy joined, in 3rd day he was doing inspection of assembly with more than 60 brackets. Big benefit.”**
>
> **“We have other states contractors working, they said computer wont be better than us, why you want to use computer. 3 months ago I showed him(a senior contractor) the one failure that went to customer and we fixed it there, then I showed him that system had pointed it too! – Now he will not move to paint shop without AI inspection.”**
>
> **“Very reliable Sir. Inspector has to only see whenever it shows check and only the areas of red boxes. Impossible to see so many checks repetitively without system now.”**
>
> **“It is impossible to check 65 brackets. Our eyes will deceive us.”**
>
> **“Last week I was at customer site for meeting. I got WhatsApp alert for not-ok and sent to my boy at plant. He called and confirmed beeper bracket was missed and that he had reworked and reinspected. Earlier I will come to know later and sometimes they won’t even tell.”**
