Safety isn’t just about reporting — it’s about responding.  
**AISee** sends **instant alerts with images** to the **actual operating staff** via WhatsApp or the mobile app.  
If someone misses a helmet or enters a restricted zone, supervisors know immediately — with a visual alert they can act on.  

This closes the gap between observation and action.  
No waiting for reports. No missed incidents.  
Just timely information that helps people fix issues right where they happen.  

### Why teams love it  
- Visual alerts are easy to understand  
- Works in multiple languages  
- No training needed — runs on existing CCTV  

AISee turns your cameras into **24x7 safety partners** — always watching, always ready to help your team stay safe.
