For years, safety audits have relied on manual observations and checklists — difficult to sustain and nearly impossible to measure objectively.  
With **AISee**, shop floors now gain **measurable, daily metrics** for safety adherence using their existing CCTV feeds.  

AISee’s Vision-AI technology automatically detects safety gear like **helmets, jackets, and goggles**, logs compliance by shift, and builds visual trend reports.  
Supervisors and managers can see at a glance how safety compliance evolves over time — by workstation, by shift, and by department.  

### Why it matters  
✅ Data-backed proof of adherence  
✅ No additional staff or hardware  
✅ Clear trends for corrective and preventive action
