At AICUE DATA LAB, we recently had the opportunity to showcase our product **VISPECT — Visual Inspection with AI (using just a mobile)** at the DICV Quality Summit.

Over the course of the event, more than 50 visitors from various functions stopped by our stall to learn how VISPECT can help transform traditional visual inspection into a digital, data-driven process.

## Why VISPECT caught attention

> VISPECT is designed for manufacturing and quality teams who want to:

- Standardize visual inspection procedures
- Reduce manual errors and subjectivity
- Capture images and data directly from the shop floor using only a mobile device
- Build a searchable, analyzable history of inspection results over time

Many visitors were particularly interested in how VISPECT can be deployed without expensive cameras or complex hardware — making it a practical solution for shop floors that want to adopt AI quickly and cost-effectively.

## Our presence at the DICV Quality Summit

Our stall featured live demos of VISPECT, sample inspection flows, and visuals of how the solution integrates into existing quality processes. We had engaging discussions around use cases such as:

- Visual inspection of assemblies and aggregates
- Standardizing inspection criteria across shifts and plants
- Supporting continuous improvement and audit readiness

We were honoured to receive a souvenir from the organizers and appreciate the warm response and curiosity from the DICV team and participants.
